Repository for Chapter 6 - Lab 6


# Lab Objectives:
Implement operations of singly-linked lists and doubly-linked lists.
Demonstrate understanding of insert, remove, search, and traversal operations.
Explore and implement array-based lists.

#Instructions:

Part A – Singly-Linked Lists: Tim

Create a Python class to implement a singly-linked list.
Implement methods to append, insert, remove, search, and display list elements.

Part B – Doubly-Linked Lists: Megan
Extend your implementation from Part A to include a doubly-linked list.
Implement methods for prepend, insert_after, remove_after, and traversal both forwards and backwards.

Part C – Array-based Lists: Michael
Implement array-based list operations in Python.
Demonstrate insertion, deletion, and searching within array-based lists.

Part D – Comparative Analysis: group merge work
Provide a brief analysis comparing the efficiency and practical use cases of singly-linked lists,
doubly-linked lists, and array-based lists.
